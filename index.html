	<h1>Nicolas Yan</h1>
	<p>I am a Senior at Harvard College studying Social Studies with a research focus on Technology and the Future of Work. I am a <a href="https://gocrimson.com/sports/mcrew-hw/2019-20/bios/yan_nicolas_y7ex">coxswain</a> on the Men's Heavyweight Crew team and a peer tutor at the Harvard College Writing Center.</p>
	<p>I was born in Palo Alto, California (which I am quick to point out when the integrity of my support for Bay Area sports teams is brought into question) but I currently live in Auckland, New Zealand. In my free time, I enjoy going on ski trips, listening to music, thrift shopping, watching sport, and parking up with a good <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44310786-nicolas-yan">book</a>.</p>
