	<h1>Nicolas Yan</h1>
	<p>I am a Senior at Harvard College studying Social Studies with a research focus on Technology and the Future of Work. I am a coxswain on the Men's Heavyweight Crew team and a peer tutor at the Harvard College Writing Center.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I was born in Palo Alto, California (which I am quick to point out when the integrity of my support for Bay Area sports teams is brought into question) but I currently live in Auckland, New Zealand. In my free time, I enjoy going on ski trips, listening to music, thrift shopping, watching sport (rugby, basketball, cricket, and football), and parking up with a good book.</p>
